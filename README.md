# Overview

As a software engineer continually expanding my skill set, I created a command-line calculator application to deepen my understanding of the C++ programming language. My goal was to gain hands-on experience with core C++ features such as variables, functions, conditionals, loops, object-oriented programming, and the Standard Template Library (STL).

The software is a simple, interactive calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations, stores a history of user calculations using a vector, and provides file handling functionality to save and retrieve previous calculations. Itâ€™s designed with a class-based structure to ensure modularity and code organization.

This project helped me explore essential aspects of the C++ language, such as memory safety, user input validation, and data persistence. It also gave me practical experience using vectors and file I/O streams in C++.

# Development Environment

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  
- **Compiler**: MinGW (GCC for Windows)  
- **Operating System**: Windows 10  
- **Language**: C++17  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - `<iostream>` for console I/O  
  - `<vector>` from the STL for storing calculation history  
  - `<fstream>` for file handling  
  - `<limits>` for input validation

# Future Work

- Add support for more advanced operations (exponents, modulus, etc.)
- Implement dynamic memory with `new` and `delete` for additional stretch challenge
- Refactor code to support a graphical user interface (GUI) in the future
- Improve error messages and make them more user-friendly
- Add unit tests for key components of the calculator
